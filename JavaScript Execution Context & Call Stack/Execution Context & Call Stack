# 📌 JavaScript Execution Context & Call Stack (Deep Notes)

These notes explain **how JavaScript code is executed internally**, including:

* Global Execution Context
* Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting)
* Execution Phase
* Function Execution Context
* Call Stack (LIFO)
* Variable Environment & Execution Thread

> 🧠 **Goal:** Understand *what happens behind the scenes* when JavaScript runs your code.

## 🧠 What is Execution Context?

An **Execution Context (EC)** is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.

Every Execution Context has **3 components**:

1. **Memory / Variable Environment**
2. **Execution Thread**
3. **`this` keyword**

---

## 🔹 Types of Execution Context

| Type                                 | Description                       |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Global Execution Context (GEC)**   | Created first, only once          |
| **Function Execution Context (FEC)** | Created for each function call    |
| **Eval Execution Context**           | Created by `eval()` (rarely used) |

---

## 🔹 Global Execution Context (GEC)

When JavaScript starts executing:

1. **Global Execution Context is created**
2. `this` → refers to **`window` (browser)** or **`global` (Node.js)**
3. Code runs in **two phases**

---

## 🔁 Phase 1: Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting)

* Variables declared with `let` / `var` → `undefined`
* Functions → stored with full definition

### Example:

```js
let val1 = 10
let val2 = 5

function addNum(num1, num2) {
  let total = num1 + num2
  return total
}

let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
let result2 = addNum(10, 2)
```

### Memory Phase:

```txt
val1     → undefined
val2     → undefined
addNum  → function definition
result1 → undefined
result2 → undefined
```

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Execution Phase

Now JavaScript executes line by line:

```txt
val1 = 10
val2 = 5
```

---

## 🔁 Function Execution Context (FEC)

When `addNum()` is called:

1. A **new Function Execution Context** is created
2. It has its own:

   * Memory Phase
   * Execution Phase
3. After execution → context is **deleted**

### Function Memory Phase:

```txt
num1 → undefined
num2 → undefined
total → undefined
```

### Function Execution Phase:

```txt
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
total = 15
return 15
```

---

## 🧺 Call Stack (LIFO – Last In First Out)

The **Call Stack** manages execution contexts.

### Order:

```txt
Global Execution Context
↓
addNum(val1, val2)
↓
addNum(10, 2)
```

### After execution:

```txt
addNum() removed
addNum() removed
Global EC remains
```

> 📌 **Rule:**
> Last function called → executed first → removed first

---

## 🧵 Execution Thread

* JavaScript is **single-threaded**
* Only **one command executes at a time**
* Execution happens **inside an Execution Context**

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways (Interview Gold)

✔ JavaScript runs in **two phases**
✔ Functions create **their own execution context**
✔ Call Stack follows **LIFO**
✔ Hoisting happens in **Memory Phase**
✔ `this` is set during **Execution Context creation**

## ⭐ Final Tip

If you understand **Execution Context + Call Stack**, you will:

* Debug faster
* Master closures
* Understand async JS better
* Crack interviews confidently
